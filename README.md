## Features
You can easily search repositories on GitHub by a term and add the selected results to categories you created. Results will be cached until next search.
- Synchronize to update with the latest repository data, one by one, or enable the Auto Sync feature!
- You will know if a bookmarked repository was deleted or became private by the author.
- Manage your bookmarks with Export and Import.
- GIT clone capabilities (GIT installed is required)


### Setup settings

- *Auto Sync Enabled*: synchronizes your bookmarks every time the extension is activated. `default: true`.
- *Default Clone Path*: it will set the path for every time you hit the *Clone repository* button. Otherwise, GitMarker will popup a dialog where you can choose the folder you want the repository to be cloned.
- *Use Default Clone Path*: enables/disables using the Default Clone Path, defined above. `default: false`.
- *Search Results Per Page*: sets the number of records per page when searching repositories on GitHub. `maximum: 100`.

## Notes
GitMarker uses [GitHub API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/guides/getting-started-with-the-rest-api) for its features, like searching and synchronizing repositories. According to the documentation:

> Unauthenticated clients can make 60 requests per hour. To get more requests per hour, we'll need to authenticate. In fact, doing anything interesting with the GitHub API requires authentication.

I recommend you set a [Personal Access Token (PAT)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) on GitMarker to have the best experience. Once it's all set, GitMarker stores it in the <b>secret storage</b> to ensure your token will not be read or misused by other extensions.

The extension was fully developed with <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/" target="_blank">Typescript</a> using Visual Studio Code and its <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/api" target="_blank">Extension API</a>.
